Developing an iOS App which connect to a BLE device can be tedious. BLE connectivity is limited when working in Xcode Simulator and debugging can be tricky. Hugues shares some tips that help having a faster and most robust development cycle:
* Implementing Unit Tests to validate your BLE data transformation
* Containing your BLE layer using wrappers and protocols to be able to work on your App even in the Simulator
* Developing a Device Simulator (another iOS App) to simulate your device in order to avoid being block by longer hardware development cycle

This talk is not a BLE introduction, you should check Apple WWDC videos to get a good overview:
* WWDC 2012 - Core Bluetooth 101
* WWDC 2012 - Advanced Core Bluetooth
* WWDC 2013 - Core Bluetooth

You can also follow this good tutorial to work with BLE: [http://www.cloudcity.io/blog/2015/06/11/zero-to-ble-on-ios-part-one](http://www.cloudcity.io/blog/2015/06/11/zero-to-ble-on-ios-part-one)

Hugues has also done a workshop about BLE on iOS at FrenchKit 2015: [https://speakerdeck.com/huguesbr/introduction-to-ble-on-ios](https://speakerdeck.com/huguesbr/introduction-to-ble-on-ios)
